# optimization-portfolio
Implementations of mathematical optimization algorithms and applications, from theory to real-world problems.

This repository is a collection of projects exploring mathematical optimization â€” from fundamental algorithms implemented from scratch to applied case studies in data science, operations research, and systems modeling. Each project includes both the theoretical background and a practical Python implementation, with visualizations and clear documentation. The goal is to demonstrate a solid understanding of optimization theory and the ability to translate it into real-world problem solving.
